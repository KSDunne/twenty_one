## Purpose of the project

Twenty One is a Python terminal game. The game of Twenty One is well known. It is also known as Black Jack. This game runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Traditionally, in a casino setting, the player would play against a dealer. This would be in a card game, table setting. In the case of this deployed game, the user is trying to beat the computer. The game built here is interactive and it provides feedback to the user as they play. All errors are handled and the user can seamlessly play again, without having to manually run the program from scratch.
